# [GO] WYAG
Golang: Write Yourself a Git.

This is a learning exercise in understanding some of the internal workings of
[git](https://git-scm.com/), through following the excellent tutorial
[Write Yourself a Git](wyag.thb.lt).

This repo aims to recreate the steps documented in the original WYAG site, 
except using Golang in lieu of Python.

## Development
### tl;dr

```bash
git clone git@github.com:clagraff/gowyag
go get
go build
./main
```

## License
Gowyag, a recreate of the original [Write Yourself a Git](wyag.thb.lt)
application, written in Golang.
